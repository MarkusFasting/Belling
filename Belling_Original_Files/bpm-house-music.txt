House music, we’ve all heard of it, but what gives it that rhythm? In this article you will learn about the BPM range of house music
Deep House, Electro House, Minimal House... that's just naming a few of the sub-genres you may have heard of keeping a nightclub pumping until the early hours of the morning. You also might have noticed that they all have something in common: The BPM, or beats per minute. This is what defines the rhythm of dance music and more importantly, helps a DJ be able to mix it. Originating from disco music, the style of the house genre has always been very recognisable due to its distinctive beat patterns and soulful disco chords.
House music tracks generally range from 115-130 BPM.
House is a music genre characterised by a repetitive four-to-the-floor beat and jazzy soulful chords.
The speed, or tempo, of a track, is determined by the BPM (beats per minute).
House is a genre within the EDM umbrella.
Originating in Chicago, House music has reached every corner of the globe.
Beats per minute (BPM) is used to measure the tempo of a song. The higher the number, the faster the track. They are very important if you're trying to learn how to DJ, produce music, or identify a genre. It's the information you need to match two tracks together to create a DJ mix. Knowing the BPM of common genres including house, techno and garage music is a vital tool when DJ'ing. When DJs play a track, they use the BPM to work out which tracks would be best to play next. For instance, if you were to try and mix a house track at 115 BPM into another at 130 BPM, without matching the BPM, it would sound awful. You may be breaking boundaries but you might also break some eardrums.
To measure the tempo of a track we use BPM. Typically, the higher the BPM, the more energetic and upbeat the song will be. Slower BPMs generally indicate a more mellow vibe. The choice of BPM for a track can significantly alter the mood of your production. Not every track produced within a genre is exactly the same tempo, but most genres do have typical tempo ranges that producers will often stick to. Keeping a track within a certain tempo range not only helps the audience connect with a certain rhythm and genre, but can also help DJs beat match and construct sets and transitions.
The BPM of a House track will generally range from 115-130 depending on the style. Sticking between that tempo range is an important element of the genre, setting it apart from other EDM music based on the BPM. In fact, the BPM is a primary characteristic when it comes to identifying electronic music. Significantly slower than other genres like techno or trance, which usually range between 128-150BPM, House music has a much more funky disco vibe. While there are some exceptions to this rule (for example, some progressive house tracks have been known to go up to 160 BPM), the vast majority of house tracks will fall somewhere within this range.
Examples of some slower House tracks such as Frankie Knuckles - 'Your Love' or Jesse Saunders - 'On and On' whereas examples of a faster Deep House track would be something like 'Rescue Me' by Groove Armada. With the help of tools like DJ.Studio, the BPM of a certain track or playlist is easily determined by the algorithm among many other things. This can help understand the speed, energy and harmonic values, leading to a much more in-depth and accurate mixing experience. It will also enable you to choose tracks to mix in between two which may have a big tempo difference.

House music is a form of electronic dance music that originated in Chicago in the early 1980s and quickly expanded to American cities like New York City and Detroit as well as international music hubs like London and Paris. House and its many sub-genres are characterised by a steady pulse of a kick drum, usually in a 4/4 time signature.
Early days: House emerged as an underground music genre in Chicago in the early 1980s. Its pioneers were a group of Black American DJs who were well-versed in disco and hip-hop, and who embraced emerging synthesiser technology from brands like Roland and Korg. Some of the most legendary producers and DJs of early House tracks include Ron Hardy, Frankie Knuckles, Jesse Saunders, Jack Master Silk, Jackmaster, Marshall Jefferson, and Larry Heard (aka Mr Fingers).
Chicago roots: Music historians typically trace house music to a nightclub called the Warehouse, located in Chicago's West Loop neighbourhood. There, DJ Frankie Knuckles—sometimes called the "godfather of house”—created this new sound: continuous dance grooves by splicing together records with a steady four-on-the-floor bass drum pulse and tempos ranging from 120 to 130 bpm. DJs at the famous Paradise Garage nightclub would also play House which they would create from stripped-down disco tracks they would find in a record store.
House music today: House has remained a consistent crowd-pleaser at raves and on dance playlists, and it has also reached the Top 40 at various points. French house groups like Daft Punk and St. Germain have released platinum records featuring their house music productions.
