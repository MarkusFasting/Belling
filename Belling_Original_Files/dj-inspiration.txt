One of the most important elements of being a successful DJ is the ability to constantly share new music with your audience. Whether you're a hip hop DJ or an oldschool raver, you don’t want to get stuck in a rut playing the same 10 tracks in every mix you make. The most interesting DJ sets are usually full of new music and remixes that the audience hasn’t heard before (unless you’re a wedding DJ).
Constantly bringing new dance music into your mixes is a great way to keep your performances fresh and exciting, ensuring that your audiences won’t get tired of hearing the same set churned out every time. It can also earn you a reputation in the DJ scene as an innovator in music discovery, always sharing the latest hidden gems.
Having a good method for finding new songs is often underappreciated by many DJs, who instead focus on flashy techniques and distracting gear. Sharing new music is key; you need to develop a good method of music discovery.
If you ever get stuck in a creative DJ rut, often the key to breaking this barrier is finding new music that re-inspires you as a DJ and motivates you to carry on mixing. Sure, some tracks are usually certified floor-fillers, but you don’t want to rely on these all the time. You might get the party going a couple of times, but if you have the same audience, eventually they’ll get bored. These are just some of the reasons why constantly rotating new music is an essential component of great DJing.
You’re now aware of how important musical discovery is for DJs, especially when it comes to electronic music, so let’s get stuck into the methods.
They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, which is true in most cases. While you don’t want to copy other DJ’s sets track for track, there’s nothing wrong with looking up a couple of track IDs that you love from their sets and using them in your own mixes. You can get inspiration from various DJs, including hip hop DJs, to diversify your sets.
1001Tracklists is the ultimate tool in this kind of situation. It’s essentially a DJ mix ID platform. Users upload links to DJ mixes (from concerts, festivals, podcasts, radio, etc.), and then the community collectively helps to ID all the tracks in a mix (where possible).
If you’re looking for some track IDs in a mix, search the set on 1001Tracklists and see if the IDs are there. They have a huge collection and it’s updated constantly with the latest sets. This is great if there are specific tracks you’re trying to find, but it’s also perfect for general discovery. Because it has such a huge database, you’ll probably be able to find a whole bunch of ID’d sets from your favorite DJ (just search their name), and from there you can cherry-pick any tracks that catch your ear. You can thank me later!
DJ.Studio is fully integrated with 1001Tracklists. From inside the app, you can browse DJ sets, pick out tracks, and add them directly to your timeline mix project.
Another basic (but often overlooked) method is simply browsing YouTube playlists. Whatever genre you’re looking for, chances are, somebody has already made a massive YouTube playlist full of bangers. You can browse, import, and DJ YouTube directly from within DJ.Studio.
I'd recommend making your own playlist and adding the songs you like to it. You can then import your YouTube playlist into DJ.Studio and instantly make a mix from the entire list. This is a great way to experiment with songs before buying them.
Love it or loathe it, AI is undeniably a powerful tool for people working in music, particularly DJs. While some services are better than others, there are a bunch of platforms out there which can use AI to suggest similar music based on a selection of tracks that you feed to the algorithm.
One of the best platforms for this method is Spotify, and you can seamlessly DJ using Spotify and DJ.Studio.
You can also copy links to Spotify tracks and playlists into DJ.Studio and start experimenting with them in a DJ mix. This is useful for testing out any song without buying it.
When it comes to unearthing hidden gems for your DJ sets, thinking outside the box can yield surprising results. Here are some unconventional sources you might not have considered:
Radio Shows and Podcasts: Tune into specialist radio shows and podcasts that focus on your genre. DJs and hosts often play exclusive tracks and upcoming releases that haven't hit mainstream platforms yet. Stations like BBC Radio 1, NTS Radio, and independent podcasts can be great resources.
Engaging with communities of like-minded music enthusiasts can expand your musical horizons and provide fresh inspiration. Here's how to tap into these networks:
Attend Live Events and Festivals: Nothing beats the energy of live music for discovering new sounds. Attend local gigs, underground raves, and music festivals to hear what other DJs are playing. Networking with fellow DJs and producers can also lead to track swaps and collaborations.
Collaborate with Other DJs and Producers: Working with other DJs and producers can introduce you to different music styles and production techniques. Collaborations can inspire you to explore new genres and incorporate diverse influences into your sets.
To stay relevant and innovative as a DJ, it's essential to keep up with the latest music trends. Here are some strategies to ensure you're always ahead of the curve:
Follow Influential DJs and Producers: Keep an eye on what influential DJs and producers are playing. Their sets often feature cutting-edge tracks and unreleased material. Following their social media accounts and attending their live shows can give you insights into the latest trends.
Creating a distinct mixing style is essential for standing out as a DJ. Your style reflects your personality and influences, making your sets unique and memorable. Here are some tips to help you develop and refine your mixing style:
Listening to sets by renowned DJs can be incredibly inspiring. Pay attention to their techniques, track selection, and how they build their sets. Notice how they transition between tracks, create tension, and maintain energy. Some DJs to study include Carl Cox, Sasha, and Annie Mac, known for their innovative styles and masterful mixing.
Experimenting with blending different genres can lead to a fresh and exciting sound. Don't be afraid to mix unexpected tracks, like combining house with hip-hop or techno with ambient. This can create a unique listening experience and showcase your versatility. DJ.Studio's Automix feature can help you experiment with different genre combinations, suggesting tracks that harmonize well together.
Creating signature transitions can set your mixes apart. Whether it’s a specific type of beat matching, a favorite effect, or a unique way of blending tracks, having recognizable transitions can make your sets memorable. Practice and refine these techniques using DJ.Studio‘s detailed timeline editor, where you can fine-tune transitions and effects with precision.
Adding live elements to your sets, such as live remixing, looping, or using samples, can make your performances more dynamic and engaging. Use DJ.Studio's advanced features to incorporate these elements seamlessly. Experiment with different loops, samples, and effects to create a unique live experience that captivates your audience.
Think of your DJ set as a journey or story. Start with an introduction that sets the mood, build up to a peak, and then bring it down to a satisfying conclusion. This storytelling approach keeps your audience engaged and makes your sets more memorable. Use DJ.Studio's arrangement tools to plan and structure your mix, ensuring a smooth and compelling flow.
While it's important to draw inspiration from others, it's equally crucial to stay true to your own musical tastes and instincts. Your authenticity will resonate with your audience and help you build a loyal following. Trust your intuition when selecting tracks and crafting your mix.
The world of DJing is constantly evolving, with new techniques, technologies, and trends emerging regularly. Stay updated with the latest developments, attend workshops, and seek feedback from peers and mentors. DJ.Studio's community platform is a great place to connect with other DJs, share your mixes, and receive constructive feedback.
With the above methods, you'll have no trouble finding a constant stream of new and exciting music to use in your mixes. But how exactly can you go about testing them out and incorporating them into a mix? DJ.Studio is the answer.
DJ.Studio is a new type of DJ software offering a wide range of unique features unlike any mainstream DJ apps, but one field it excels in is discovery and experimentation. Because all of the platforms above are integrated into the app, you can use it as a hub for discovering new music and testing out tracks.
To understand what DJ.Studio is, and why it's so useful in this situation, check out the workflow:
6. Share your mix. In YouTube mode, you can use the DJ.Studio online mix-sharing system to create a streamable link of your mix. Because DRM prevents you from downloading YouTube audio, you have to share it on the community platform. Although this can be accessed from anywhere with the internet—all you need is a copy of the URL, you don’t need an account, and it works on mobile. In local file mode (where you import MP3s/WAVs), you can download your mixes as files, videos, or Ableton live sets.
As you can see, the DJ.Studio mix creation method is unique and unlike traditional DJ software. This increases the production times of mixes and lets you craft mixes in more detail without rehearsing.
Thanks to the integration with the mentioned streaming platforms (and most other DJ software libraries), you don’t need to open thousands of tabs and flick between apps to compile music from a range of sources. It's also connected to Beatport (in beta).
This just shows one way of using DJ.Studio as a discovery and mix creation tool. You can use it in a range of other ways.
One of the best ways to keep your sets fresh is by experimenting with new genres. DJ.Studio makes it easy to explore different styles and seamlessly integrate them into your mixes:
Create Genre-Specific Projects: Start new projects dedicated to exploring specific genres. Import tracks from different sources and use DJ.Studio's tools to blend them together. This approach allows you to understand the nuances of each genre and how to mix them effectively.
Mix Different Genres Together: Challenge yourself by combining tracks from different genres. DJ.Studio's Automix and transition tools can help you find the best way to merge diverse styles, creating a unique and eclectic mix.
By utilizing these strategies and the powerful features of DJ.Studio, you'll continuously unlock new sources of inspiration and keep your DJ sets exciting and dynamic.
