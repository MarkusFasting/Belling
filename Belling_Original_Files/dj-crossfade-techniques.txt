A crossfade is a technique that refers to smoothly blending two audio parameters in the opposite direction of each other - typically volume. Understanding how to use it is essential to learn How To Properly Mix Music.
The simplest example to understand this is the volume of a track being decreased at the same rate that a second track's volume is being increased. Crossfades aren't specific to DJing and are also used in general audio engineering, although it is a central technique in DJing.
A crossfade doesn't necessarily need to be used with volume, as most parameters on a DJ mixer can also be crossfaded, for example, filters, EQs, and other effects. Find out more about EQ DJ Mixing in our full guide!
The crossfader is a control on DJ mixers and DJ software that is used to control the volume balance between two tracks. These aren't to be confused with channel faders, which control the volume of tracks independently. In essence, DJs crossfade songs using a crossfader to create a smooth transition.
Physically, crossfaders have a low resistance in their feeling, meaning it's quicker and easier to flip them from one side to the other - in a split second. This is different to channel faders, which have a stiffer feel.
A crossfader is an essential tool for the scratching technique, where DJs use the crossfader to rhythmically change the volume while scratching a record to create cool sound effects.

Here are 5 useful crossfader DJ techniques! You should also learn how to use Phrasing DJ Mixing to get the most out of these methods.
One thing to understand is the types of crossfader curves you can use. This changes how the transitions occur from one parameter to the other - whether it is a slow and gradual fade, or a bit quicker.
You can think of this as percentages, look at each of the pictures below, to see how DJ.studio offers a range of different curve types to create unique crossfade transitions.
100% - Fades across the entire length of the transition.
75% - The fade lasts for 75% of the transition.
50% - The fade starts half way through the transition.
25% - The fade only covers the last quarter of the transition.
One of the easiest crossfade methods is a slow transition from one channel to the other. This achieves a smooth, gradual transition between tracks, which is ideal for more repetitive genres like techno and house music.
For this method, start by making sure both tracks are beat-matched, and that the crossfader is full to one channel, muting the other. When the time is right, you can slowly move the crossfader to the other side, lowering the volume of the first track and increasing the volume of the second.
Eventually, you will have crossfaded between track 1 to track 2. This is a great way to create a natural flow between the first track playing and the new track, without making a drastic change in feeling.
You can do this in DJ.Studio by:
Select the transition window of the transition you wish to change.
Move the handles on the edge of the transition window to set the transition boundaries, for a slow transition, a wider transition window is best.
Select the 100% crossfade preset in the transition window, and adjust the parameter lines to taste.
The crossfader is also the perfect tool for making faster cuts between songs. This creates a more noticeable, high-impact transition which is great for swapping from the buildup of one song to the drop of another. These instant transitions are great for all kinds of music, but particularly any that revolve around build-ups and breakdowns.
For example, beat-match both tracks, then use phrasing to make sure that the different sections (verse, chorus, buildup, drop) are aligned well. Ensure that the buildup of a track would end when the new track has a drop. Now, when the buildup finishes, instantly cut the crossfader to the other side, cutting the old song and playing the new song. This creates an exciting transition.
This is easily achieved in DJ.Studio using a fast-cut curve from the transition presets.
To create this in DJ.Studio:
Move the transition window handles to set the start and end point of the transition - in this case you want something quite short by moving the right handle as close to the left handle as possible.
Choose the 100% crossfade transition preset, or use Manual if you want to draw in a tighter cut.
Another cool method is using the crossfader to switch back and forth between two songs, usually in some kind of rhythmic pattern. This can be used to create cool live remixes of songs and add a bite more expression into your mixes.
To add this type of crossfading in DJ.Studio:
Choose the Manual transition preset
Add automation points in the transition window for both tracks to create this pattern.
This fun technique is commonly used by hip-hop, dubstep, drum and bass, and other DJs. This isn't the kind of technique you can use for a full transition but is a good way to add some creative expression and excitement to your mixes.
It's simple - make sure the snares/claps of two tracks are perfectly in time. Then you can quickly flick the crossfader over to the other side when the snare of the other song hits, and then pull it back. This creates an interesting remix where the snare of the new song is overlaid over the first.
You can experiment with this method, it doesn't have to be the snare! You can do this with any musical element. This technique is a great way to get your audience excited, and also show off your DJ mixing skills and creativity.
DJ Studio makes it super easy to crossfade between tracks. You can quickly make any kind of crossfade transition you want to - with any of the fade-able effects.
Open the transition tab
Click on a transition window between two songs you want to edit
Select the parameter you wish to crossfade and select 'crossfade'
Now you can fine-tune the crossfade curve by clicking the percentage value.
Alternatively, you can use the 'manual' preset to draw in your own custom crossfade transitions.

Don't forget these 7 Bad DJ Mixing Mistakes to Avoid.
The best way to improve your DJ transitions is by learning the methods and theories and practicing them as much as you can. There are countless different ways to transition, so one of the best things to do is study your favorite DJs, learn how they make transitions you like, and try to replicate them.
Two of the most important things to learn are beat matching and harmonic mixing, which are the foundations of a clean transition. You should check out our full guide on Transition Techniques to get some inspiration!
There are loads of useful DJ transition techniques and concepts.
Seamless Blend - The DJ slowly turns down one track, while bringing up the other. This can be done over a relatively long amount of time. To ensure a seamless blend, both tracks must be beat-matched, and harmonically mixed.
The Bass Swap - This is a high-impact mix where the Dj takes out the bassline of one track and swaps it with the bass of a new track. The DJ then starts to swap the other elements over, like the highs and mids.
The Instant Cut - this is the quickest and hardest-hitting type of transition. This works best when the songs have been phase aligned - particularly the buildups and drops. When the buildup of one song is about to hit, you swap over to the drop-in of another song. This creates a quick transition.
The Outro to Intro - This works well with music like House and Techno, where there is a lot of intro and outro time. You can simply start the intro of a song at the same time as the outro of another start, both at full volume. This gives the impression that the intro of the new song is just a new layer in the outro of the last one, creating a clean and punch transition.

Generally, most DJs use the crossfader, although not always. Some genres are easier to mix with the channel faders, for example, house and techno, where you might want to bring up the volume of one track without affecting the other.
However, other genres are more suited to using a crossfader for the faster style transitions - like hip-hop. However, there are no hard or fast rules with crossfader use. It has a different sound and opens different doors compared to channel faders, but both have their uses.
The best way to improve your DJ mixing is by practicing and learning. Practice is good, but you should also expand your awareness of techniques and concepts within DJing. A great way to do this is by using DJ.Studio, which offers a new way to look at mix creation. This can be eye-opening for DJs and helps to improve their understanding, thus technique, of DJ mixing.
