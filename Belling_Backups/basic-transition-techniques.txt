A DJ transition is a technique to move between two tracks - how you mix from one track into the next.
One exciting aspect of DJ mixes is that the whole performance feels seamless. The DJ doesn't just wait for one song to finish before starting the next one, they use transition techniques to blend two tracks in a sophisticated way.
Transitions can be used in several ways. They can be smooth and transparent - the audience might barely notice that the song has changed, creating a fluid, trance-inducing mix. Alternatively, DJs can use transitions to build hype, raise the energy, the make a sudden drop into a new song to create a high-impact track change.
Transitions are all important parts of a DJ's toolbox. Without using traditions, you may as well just listen to a Spotify playlist which would be nowhere near as fun or groovy.
Transitions are the glue that ties the songs together. Mastering how to use transitions changes a DJ's ability to manipulate the groove and entertain their audience.
There are two central concepts, which underpin all the creative elements of a transition. These two foundations serve as the raw building blocks, on top of which DJs can express themselves more creatively using other transition techniques.
You also need to master DJ Cue Points to make slick transitions, and generally have a good understanding of DJ Mixing Terms is important too. Of course, you should also learn these 7 Bad DJ Mixing Mistakes to Avoid!
The first foundation of a good transition is tempo. If you beat match the BPM of the outgoing track with the incoming track, you ensure that the groove of the tracks mix perfectly together.
This is why beat matching is so important. Once two tracks are beat-matched, there are only a few other things that need to be considered to make a slick transition.
The second foundation of a great transition is key. Tracks can be sorted into 1 of 24 keys. There are 12 major keys, and 12 minor keys. Each key has strong or weak connections to others.
After you've matched the key and tempo of your two tracks, it's time to get funky with DJ transition tools.
Beyond tempo and key, there are several effects and processes which open up more creative DJ mixing transition techniques.
Volume is the first transition tool to master. It's the most unanimous technique and is a control found on every DJ mixer. In essence, every transition uses volume in some way. Even if you just let one track end and start the next, there is naturally a transition in volume.
That said, there are still a lot of incredibly creative ways you can use volume to create interesting transitions - while being a basic tool, it's also incredibly versatile and powerful, and offers an infinite range of transition possibilities.
I'll explain some more types of transitions you can make with volume in more detail later in this article.
Equalization is the second most important transition tool. EQ lets you either boost or cut the bass, mids, and treble. This lets you emphasize certain components of the current track playing.
There are a bunch of other creative effects which are equally as important in a DJ's arsenal for making exciting and compelling transitions
Another cool mixing technique is using loops and repeats. You can slice out a musical phrase, and loop it to create a new section of an arrangement. Making loops is a great way to create buildups and transitions for most electronic music.
In the old days of mixing, DJs had to use vinyl turntables. These are very physics-based and literally use a spinning platter to play music. These are more advanced techniques to pull off but can help you create some really satisfying transitions. These methods are also recreated in digital mixing tools like CDJs and software.
When you power off a vinyl turntable, it doesn't stop instantly, it gradually slows down the platter loses momentum. This creates a cool effect where the music slows down until it reaches a stop - this makes a neat trick for transitioning, and was a key technique in hip-hop.
Experimentation is the trick to learning new types of transitions. Find your own unique voice and mix technique by messing around and finding out the kind of transitions you like to play with. Combine different effects and experiments with transition speeds.
You can use any of the above tools with the following patterns. These patterns (called envelopes) show the relationship between the time and strength of a transition.
For example, you can do quick cuts, longer crossfades, or any kind of transition in between.
This is a transition where the volume of the first track is decreased at the same speed and intensity as the volume of the new track is raised. This creates a smooth - albeit uneventful mix. This is good if you want to make a more seamless mix without emphasizing a build-up or drop.
You can use these transition shapes on any control factor. It doesn't have to be volume. You can fade in filters, fade out EQs, or mix and match them as you please.
DJing and transitions are almost a language of groove in itself. There are endless combinations of music and transitions letting you get really creative, so you can play with your audience and their groove. This is one of the reasons why DJing is so fun.
Here are some demonstrations of the kind of transitions you can make. Some of these are more suited to certain music genres but you can take this as inspiration and make your own transition styles!
Now, just as the outgoing song gets close to the end, use an HPF, EQ, and some volume to rip the buildup to maximum tension point, then drop it out to silence. Now, hit play on the second track and slam it down with a heavy beat. This creates a high-impact transition which is sure to get the audience roaring.
If you want to go for a smoother sound with seamless mixes, try out a crossfade blend. With this transition, you mix tracks of the same tempo.
Just make sure you leave enough time to make the transition before the second track plays into its build-up or drop.
This is a technique for really seamless mixing. Your audience might not even be able to tell you just changed the song until the hook comes in.
In this simple transition, simply spin back the first beat at a good point, then cut in the new tune. This is a faster cut that lets you quickly switch up the vibe. It isn't the smoothest of DJ transitions, but it's still fun and useful.
Why not invent your own transitions and share them with the DJ community?
All of these techniques work well when paired with phrasing: What Is Phrasing in DJ Mixing?
When mixing live with a DJ Controller - you only have two hands, so you can only control so many variables at once.
With DJ.Studio, you can control everything at the same time. This makes it possible to create complex transitions which otherwise would be impossible - unless you had 8 pairs of hands. This means you can Make Better DJ Mixes with less skill and time.
Using this, you can create transitions that haven't been possible before.

Transitions are one of the most essential DJ skills. With these DJ transition tips, you'll be able to entertain your audience with a DJ set full of fluid and seamless blends.
My main tip is to just experiment with the different tools, and build your own vocabulary of DJ transitions!
To make a good DJ transition you need to control two core factors, and then get creative with other tools.
Beyond this, you need to get creative with the other transition tools you have available, like volume, eq, filters, loops, and other effects.
To transition songs like a DJ you need the right tools. You need some kind of system that has the capacity to play two songs simultaneously while giving you, at a minimum, a volume control, like a DJ controller.
With this type of system, you can then match the speed and beats of the two songs, then use the volume to make a smooth transition before the first song runs out.
To smoothly transition between sounds you need to take into account a couple of factors. First and most importantly you need to make sure that the tempos match and that the tracks are playing on the same beat.
DJs blend songs using a mixture of DJ gear and technique. First, the equipment like a DJ controller lets you play two songs at once, and control the volume and tone of each deck individually. Next, you need to use the right blending techniques to move from one song to the next
That said, you don't actually need hardware to mix. There is great DJ software that lets you do all the mixing from a computer alone. All you need is a bunch of music, a pc, and a mouse! DJ.Studio is a great example of this kind of futuristic and empowering DJ software.
