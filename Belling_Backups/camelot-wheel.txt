Put the Camelot wheel into action!
The Camelot Wheel is a useful system for DJs, helping them to work out which tracks to mix together based on musical keys.
In my experience, mixing your tracks in key is essential for improving the coherency and flow of your DJ sets - it also helps you avoid any awkward clashing chords that kill the dancefloor.
This is a skill that many DJs forget to learn, but using it separates the amateurs from the professionals.
In this guide, you'll learn what the Camelot Wheel is, how to use it, and why it's so important for DJs to understand!
The Camelot Wheel shows you which musical key signatures go together.
It's incredibly useful (and important) for DJs to use harmonic mixing.
DJs now have access to tools that make mixing with the Camelot Wheel effortless, like DJ.Studio.
The Camelot Wheel is a modern system to help DJs navigate the musical keys of their music. (Read more about Musical Keys here.)
It's based on the circle of fifths, with the only difference being the use of additional labels instead of using the original key names. This aims to make it easier for DJs to understand.
Each key has a unique relationship to other keys - some keys sound great together, while others sound clashy.
The purpose of the Camelot Wheel is to give DJs a simple technique for identifying which key pairs sound good - making harmonic mixing easier.
Rather than needing to understand the more complicated circle of fifths, DJs can use this system to arrange their mix playlists without spending too much time thinking about key arrangements.
Professional DJs use this system when mixing to ensure they mix two songs with well-related keys. This is vital for any music that uses harmonic and melodic elements (which is pretty much everything these days).
While harmonic mixing was traditionally seen as an advanced technique that required music theory knowledge, Camelot values it makes it easy to mix and match songs.
Nowadays there are powerful DJ software programs (like DJ.Studio) that use this system to make the process even easier, but I'll talk about that later.
⁠Mixed In Key’s Camelot Wheel organizes the keys in a way that shows you the strong connections between each key.
Each segment shows one of the 24 available keys, where each key is given a Camelot key following the  Mixed in Key notation - anywhere from 1B to 12B, or 1A to 12A. This value is also known as a Camelot value.
The Camelot wheel has two concentric rings, the outer ring shows the Major keys, while the inner ring shows Minor chords and keys.
When you identify the key of a song, you can easily work out which other keys would make a good match using the Wheel - it helps you find two keys that work together.
In essence, you can move around the wheel in different ways to find compatible key signatures and avoid key clashes.
Using the Camelot Wheel makes it super easy to choose the next song to mix harmonically into the current track based on the combination of keys.
Imagine you were playing a song in the key of A Minor - which corresponds to the label 8A in the Camelot wheel...
Same Key - Mixing other 8A songs into it is one option. It would be easy to flawlessly mix two 8A tracks together because they are in the exact same key signature, and use the same notes.
You could also move from 8A to 8B - which is the relative Major key. All Major music keys have relative minor keys which use the exact same notes, just in a different order. This makes them harmonically compatible.
You could also move a step forward or backward around the same ring of the wheel. For example, from 8A to 9A or 7A. These are harmonically connected keys, which are a perfect fifth and a perfect fourth apart from the original key respectively. There would be only one note out of place.
Change the mood, by going from the same note's major to minor key (or reverse). For example, going from C Major to C Minor, or from A Minor to A Major.
Using the Camelot system in this way makes it easy to perform harmonic mixing with any track selection and key signature.
The different types of key signature connections also create transitions with certain feels. Typically the energy and mood are changed in certain ways based on how the two keys relate.⁠
The type of key transition you make when mixing two tracks together will affect the energy and vibe of the set.
The table above shows how different keys relate, and how this affects energy and mood levels.
There are four main types of key transitions when moving between keys:
Perfect Mix - mixing two songs with the same combination of keys, like two C Major keys. This means both tracks use a selection of the same notes. This will retain the same feel and energy level
Energy Boost (+1, or Energy boost)   An upwards key change that brings the energy up.
Energy Drop (-1): A downward key change that lowers the energy.
Mood Shift:  Changing from a Major key signature to the Minor key of the same note, like C Maj to C Min.
Ask any of the top DJs about their most useful secret mixing techniques - I'd be surprised if any of them didn't mention harmonic mixing or the Camelot wheel.
In short, the wheel makes it quick and easy for DJs to mix harmonically.
It gives DJs a straightforward process to mix in key and find out the closest key signature for each track. This gives their sets a much more coherent and professional sound.
There's nothing worse than two tracks that don't have compatible key signatures being mixed together - it can completely kill the vibe of a party or show.
At the same time, clever use of keys makes thrilling and emotionally charged DJ sets, so understanding how to use them is an important skill and can really make your mixes stand out from the crowd.
The Camelot Wheel is a good base system to mix in key, however, there are software tools that use the wheel as a foundation to offer an easier, enhanced mixing experience...
Software like DJ.Studio uses the Camelot Wheel to help you find tracks that sound great together. It also offers a range of proprietary automatic mix features to instantly do the hard work for you - and it has a bunch of other useful functions for DJs.

To read a Camelot wheel, first, you need to identify the key of the song(s) you want to work with. On the wheel, you will see 24 different segments arranged in a specific pattern, each labeled with a Camelot value between 1-12 A or B. Find the key of your chosen song, and any compatible key signatures follow either in the adjacent numbers, or the other letter.
You can find out more details about how to use a Camelot Wheel in the guide above.
The Camelot Wheel system was invented by Mark Davis, a DJ who pioneered harmonic mix techniques in the 90s. This system has since become a central concept for DJs, and smart software like DJ.Studio and Mixed In Key
The Camelot format is a system based on the circle of fifths that makes it easier for DJs to mix in key.
There are a few ways to move around the Camelot Wheel. Each of the Camelot values has related neighbors which make strong connections. You can either move one step back or forward or change the letter. The full details are explained in the guide above.
If you compare a DJ who mixes in key, to one who doesn't, you'll easily be able to hear a difference in mix quality. Mixing in key gives mixes a more seamless, natural sound. You don't have to mix all the tracks in ket, but if you mix most songs with consideration to their key, it will make a killer DJ set.
A Camelot Wheel is a type of chart for helping DJs with harmonic mixing. This takes inspiration from the Circle of Fifths - a classic music theory diagram.
The Camelot Wheel helps you to identify which tracks can be mixed together cohesively based on key compatibility - and helps you to avoid mixing clashing keys.
C Major on the Camelot Wheel equates to 8B. The B Camelot values are Major, while the A values are Minor.
Camelot Theory is an adaptation of the Circle of Fifths - making it easier for people with limited musical theory knowledge to understand key compatibility. Its mostly used by DJs to help them understand which tracks (and keys) can be mixed together smoothly, using compatible key signatures.
