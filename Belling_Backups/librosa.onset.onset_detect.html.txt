Locate note onset events by picking peaks in an onset strength envelope.

(optional) pre-computed onset strength envelope
The units to encode detected onset events in.
By default, ‘frames’ are used.
If True, detected onset events are backtracked to the nearest
preceding minimum of energy.
This is primarily useful when using onsets as slice points for segmentation.
An energy function to use for backtracking detected onset events.
If none is provided, then onset_envelope is used.
If True (default), normalize the onset envelope to have minimum of 0 and
maximum of 1 prior to detection.  This is helpful for standardizing the
parameters of librosa.util.peak_pick.
Otherwise, the onset envelope is left unnormalized.
If True (default), detections are returned as an array of frames,
samples, or time indices (as specified by units=).
If False, detections are encoded as a dense boolean array where
onsets[n] is True if there’s an onset at frame index n.
See librosa.util.peak_pick for details.
estimated positions of detected onsets, in whichever units
are specified.  By default, frame indices.
If sparse=False, onsets[…, n] indicates an onset
detection at frame index n.
If no onset strength could be detected, onset_detect returns
an empty array (sparse=True) or all-False array (sparse=False).
if neither y nor onsets are provided
compute onset strength per-frame
backtracking onset events
Get onset times from a signal
Or use a pre-computed onset envelope
