Phrasing, or Phrase Mixing is a technique where the DJ pays attention to the different 'phrases', and musical structure of tracks, aligning them in a way that makes them suitably synchronized between two tracks as they blend. This is a common technique in dance music DJing, and generally helps when Mixing Songs Together.
When DJs use phrase mixing, they often 'phrase match' the next track with the first track, in such a way to maximize the flow and coherency between two tracks. This involves counting the music, and working out the song's phrasing to align and phrase match them.  This has the effect of letting songs mix together in a more natural way and giving DJs more options for creative mixes.
Without using phrase mixing, you run the risk of mixing two songs in a clunky and cluttered manner. For example, you might bring the chorus of one song in 3/4 of the way through another song's verse, which won't sound smooth.
The techniques within phrase mixing are relatively broad, and this is a concept that has a range of applications when it comes to mixing. Understanding how to use phrase mixing could turn you from a beginner into a confident DJ! You should also check out these DJ tips for beginners.
Learning how phrasing (also called 'stage matching') works, and incorporating the techniques into your mixing can make a huge improvement to the sound and flow of your sets. This is one technique that can really help you move from amateur to pro!
Here are some of the main benefits gained from understanding phrase mixing:
Cleaner, Seamless Transitions - By considering phrasing, DJs can create more coherent and flowing smooth transitions between two tracks. It helps to avoid clunky and sudden changes as the momentum and phrasing are matched from one song to the next. It also cleans up mixes, as there won't be clashing vocals and instrumental lead lines. Pair this with the Best Crossfade Techniques for maximum smoothness!
Maintain Energy and Momentum - By using the energy levels of different phrases, DJs can keep the momentum consistent throughout their mix. They can also take more control of the dance floor by bringing energy levels up or down as desired - in a smoother way. This creates a more stable flow throughout your entire mix.
Increase Creativity and Expression - Phrasing becomes another creative tool in a DJ's toolkit and expands their view of the possibilities of expression within DJing. This helps you create more interesting and exciting blends and develops your unique and memorable approach to mixing.
A Smooth, Professional Sound - Phrase mixing is a relatively simple technique that can accelerate a DJ's skills and sound from beginner to pro. DJs who phrase mix display a greater level of attention to detail, which creates a more refined and advanced listening experience. It will also help you to stand out in the competitive DJ industry. Pair this with good EQ Mixing, and your DJ sets can sound fantastic.
Control Tension and Excitement - By mastering the use of phrasing, you can also develop your skills in controlling the tension and excitement of a DJ mix. You can create more meaningful transitions and arrangements, which should increase the overall engagement of your audience.
You can quickly start to see these benefits in your mixing after a few hours of practicing phrase mixing. Don't worry, it's easier than you might think and can be made even easier with tools like DJ.Studio and its rekordbox integration!
There are a few different components inside the overall concept of phrase mixing, and you need to understand everything to be able to implement it effectively.
This section explains all the important concepts of phrase mixing (in case you don't know), and after I'll show you how to start using phrasing techniques.
By counting music, you can start to work out the song's phrasing accurately, which makes phrase matching easy. it also helps to beat match tracks.
Intro - This is the first section of a song. This is typically a minimal part of the arrangement which teases some of the upcoming elements. In electronic music, this is often a very sparse beat, which sometimes has no melodic, or even particularly indentifying elements. You count bars from when you start mixing the first bar of the intro.
Outro - This is the final section of a song, typically bringing down the energy and fading out to silence. In electronic music, outros are often long and minimal, similar to an intro. These give the DJ an easy opportunity to seamlessly mix in a new song.
A great ear training exercise is to listen to some music and try to work out where the different phrases are. If you have the patience, you could even try to manually count the bar lengths of each section. This is a fantastic way to improve your perception as a DJ.
Most DJ software will do this task for you - and often automatically analyses and marks the phrases in a song. While this makes life easier for DJs, it's still good to practice your listening skills and not always rely on technology.
A lot of songs actually use the same structural arrangement - particularly music that has been designed to be used by DJs.
By learning how tracks are commonly arranged, you can easily get to grips with phrase mixing and begin to implement it in your DJ mixes.
As you can see from the list, a lot of music revolves around 8-bar (32 beats) or 16-bar phrases. Given that most music also uses a 4/4 time signature, this makes phrase mixing a relatively easy process to use. You can easily match phrases when mixing to create coherent and seamless mixing. You just need to learn to count music!
This section explains some practical methods for implementing phrase mixing and phrase matching in your DJ sets. Make sure you have a basic understanding of the terms outlined above before trying out these techniques.
The first step in phrase mixing is to assess the phrases of songs in your music library. You don't have to do it for every song right away but start with a few songs that you want to try to mix together.
It's good to do some manual phrase counting, although, for the sake of speed and accuracy, I recommend you use something like rekordbox to automatically analyze your tracks. This is super powerful when paired with DJ.Studio, as you can see all the phrases are marked out on a timeline next to the tracks.
To get rekordbox phrases into DJ.Studio:
Connect rekordbox to DJ.Studio
Any songs used from your rekordbox library in DJ.Studio will now display the phrase markers
You can also add hot cues to the start of phrases if you want to quickly be able to jump around the track. Some AI DJ Software can help you to find new music to add to your mix!
When you want to mix two songs together with phrase mixing, you'll need to beat match them first.
This stage takes the most practice but is also the most creative and important. You can align the new phrase however you see fit - and ultimately the best places to align phrases depend on the songs you're mixing, and the type of mix you want to create.
4) Start The Transition
After you've matched the phrases, and the tracks are playing as you would like, you can start to transition into the new song. Many DJs will wait until the previous phrase of the first song has finished before transitioning, but it's up to your tastes.
You can transition between songs in an infinite range of ways - it's all up to how you want to express yourself. For inspiration on this, check out our full guide on DJ Transition Techniques, and DJ Crossfade Techniques.
After you've pulled off a seamless mix transition, it's just a matter of loading up a new song and repeating the process!
Phrasing on traditional DJ software and gear (like a mixer and decks) can be a bit tricky and takes a lot of practice until you can master it. It even takes a while to understand.
DJ.Studio makes the whole process of phrasing super easy, and can also help to just understand how it works, as it gives you a better visual representation of how phrases are matched. We added integrations with rekordbox that we recommend you try out, as this imports the assessed phrases from rekordbox into the DJ.Studio timeline.
Connect rekordbox to DJ.Studio from the settings menu (find out more in our guide on Connecting rekordbox to DJ.Studio).
Import your rekordbox tracks into the DJ.Studio library.
Simply drag the tracks around the timeline to align the phases in the transition..

There are a few stages involved with DJ mixing songs.
First, tracks are selected, then they are beat-matched, then the DJ transitions from one song to the next using the mixer controls. This is the basic process, but find out more details on our useful blog posts!
Phrasing in DJing is the process of overlapping phrases (chorus, verse, etc) of the same length to create more coherent and flowing mixes. The core practice is matching the different 'phrases' of two songs in time.
To mix DJ phrases, first, you need to figure out where phrases start throughout a track. Then you beat-match the new song and start it so the phrases are playing at the same time.
