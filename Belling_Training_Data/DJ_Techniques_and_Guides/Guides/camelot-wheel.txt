the camelot wheel is a useful system for djs, helping them to work out which tracks to mix together based on musical keys. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
in my experience, mixing your tracks in key is essential for improving the coherency and flow of your dj sets - it also helps you avoid any awkward clashing chords that kill the dancefloor. transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
this is a skill that many djs forget to learn, but using it separates the amateurs from the professionals. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
in this guide, you'll learn what the camelot wheel is, how to use it, and why it's so important for djs to understand! mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
the camelot wheel shows you which musical key signatures go together. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
it's incredibly useful (and important) for djs to use harmonic mixing. transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
djs now have access to tools that make mixing with the camelot wheel effortless, like dj.studio. transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
the camelot wheel is a modern system to help djs navigate the musical keys of their music. (read more about musical keys here.)  mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
it's based on the circle of fifths, with the only difference being the use of additional labels instead of using the original key names. this aims to make it easier for djs to understand.  mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
each key has a unique relationship to other keys - some keys sound great together, while others sound clashy. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
the purpose of the camelot wheel is to give djs a simple technique for identifying which key pairs sound good - making harmonic mixing easier. transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
rather than needing to understand the more complicated circle of fifths, djs can use this system to arrange their mix playlists without spending too much time thinking about key arrangements. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
professional djs use this system when mixing to ensure they mix two songs with well-related keys. this is vital for any music that uses harmonic and melodic elements (which is pretty much everything these days).  transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
while harmonic mixing was traditionally seen as an advanced technique that required music theory knowledge, camelot values it makes it easy to mix and match songs.  transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
nowadays there are powerful dj software programs (like dj.studio) that use this system to make the process even easier, but i'll talk about that later. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
⁠mixed in key’s camelot wheel organizes the keys in a way that shows you the strong connections between each key. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
each segment shows one of the 24 available keys, where each key is given a camelot key following the  mixed in key notation - anywhere from 1b to 12b, or 1a to 12a. this value is also known as a camelot value. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
the camelot wheel has two concentric rings, the outer ring shows the major keys, while the inner ring shows minor chords and keys. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
when you identify the key of a song, you can easily work out which other keys would make a good match using the wheel - it helps you find two keys that work together. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
in essence, you can move around the wheel in different ways to find compatible key signatures and avoid key clashes. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
for example, you can move one step left or right around the wheel, or you can move from the outside to the inside ring (or vice versa). mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
using the camelot wheel makes it super easy to choose the next song to mix harmonically into the current track based on the combination of keys. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
imagine you were playing a song in the key of a minor - which corresponds to the label 8a in the camelot wheel... mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
same key - mixing other 8a songs into it is one option. it would be easy to flawlessly mix two 8a tracks together because they are in the exact same key signature, and use the same notes. transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
you could also move from 8a to 8b - which is the relative major key. all major music keys have relative minor keys which use the exact same notes, just in a different order. this makes them harmonically compatible. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
you could also move a step forward or backward around the same ring of the wheel. for example, from 8a to 9a or 7a. these are harmonically connected keys, which are a perfect fifth and a perfect fourth apart from the original key respectively. there would be only one note out of place. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
change the mood, by going from the same note's major to minor key (or reverse). for example, going from c major to c minor, or from a minor to a major. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
using the camelot system in this way makes it easy to perform harmonic mixing with any track selection and key signature. transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
the different types of key signature connections also create transitions with certain feels. typically the energy and mood are changed in certain ways based on how the two keys relate.⁠ mixing beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
the type of key transition you make when mixing two tracks together will affect the energy and vibe of the set. beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
the table above shows how different keys relate, and how this affects energy and mood levels. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
there are four main types of key transitions when moving between keys: mixing beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
perfect mix - mixing two songs with the same combination of keys, like two c major keys. this means both tracks use a selection of the same notes. this will retain the same feel and energy level transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
energy boost (+1, or energy boost)   an upwards key change that brings the energy up. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
energy drop (-1): a downward key change that lowers the energy. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
mood shift:  changing from a major key signature to the minor key of the same note, like c maj to c min. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
ask any of the top djs about their most useful secret mixing techniques - i'd be surprised if any of them didn't mention harmonic mixing or the camelot wheel. transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
in short, the wheel makes it quick and easy for djs to mix harmonically. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
it gives djs a straightforward process to mix in key and find out the closest key signature for each track. this gives their sets a much more coherent and professional sound. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
there's nothing worse than two tracks that don't have compatible key signatures being mixed together - it can completely kill the vibe of a party or show. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
at the same time, clever use of keys makes thrilling and emotionally charged dj sets, so understanding how to use them is an important skill and can really make your mixes stand out from the crowd. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
the camelot wheel is a good base system to mix in key, however, there are software tools that use the wheel as a foundation to offer an easier, enhanced mixing experience... transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm

to read a camelot wheel, first, you need to identify the key of the song(s) you want to work with. on the wheel, you will see 24 different segments arranged in a specific pattern, each labeled with a camelot value between 1-12 a or b. find the key of your chosen song, and any compatible key signatures follow either in the adjacent numbers, or the other letter. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
you can find out more details about how to use a camelot wheel in the guide above. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
the camelot wheel system was invented by mark davis, a dj who pioneered harmonic mix techniques in the 90s. this system has since become a central concept for djs, and smart software like dj.studio and mixed in key mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
the camelot format is a system based on the circle of fifths that makes it easier for djs to mix in key. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
there are a few ways to move around the camelot wheel. each of the camelot values has related neighbors which make strong connections. you can either move one step back or forward or change the letter. the full details are explained in the guide above. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
if you compare a dj who mixes in key, to one who doesn't, you'll easily be able to hear a difference in mix quality. mixing in key gives mixes a more seamless, natural sound. you don't have to mix all the tracks in ket, but if you mix most songs with consideration to their key, it will make a killer dj set. transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
a camelot wheel is a type of chart for helping djs with harmonic mixing. this takes inspiration from the circle of fifths - a classic music theory diagram.  transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
the camelot wheel helps you to identify which tracks can be mixed together cohesively based on key compatibility - and helps you to avoid mixing clashing keys.  transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
c major on the camelot wheel equates to 8b. the b camelot values are major, while the a values are minor.  mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
camelot theory is an adaptation of the circle of fifths - making it easier for people with limited musical theory knowledge to understand key compatibility. its mostly used by djs to help them understand which tracks (and keys) can be mixed together smoothly, using compatible key signatures.  mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
