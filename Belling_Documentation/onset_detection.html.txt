automatic detection of musical events in an audio signal is one of the most fundamental tasks in music information retrieval. here, we will show how to detect an onset, the very instant that marks the beginning of the transient part of a sound, or the earliest moment at which a transient can be reliably detected. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
librosa.onset.onset_detect works in the following way: mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
compute the frame indices for estimated onsets in a signal: mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
convert onsets to units of seconds: mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
plot the onsets on top of a spectrogram of the audio: mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
let's also plot the onsets with the time-domain waveform. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
we can add a click at the location of each detected onset. mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
listen to the original audio plus the detected onsets. one way is to add the signals together, sample-wise: mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
in librosa.onset.onset_detect, use the backtrack=true parameter. what does that do, and how does it affect the detected onsets? (see librosa.onset.onset_backtrack.) mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
in librosa.onset.onset_detect, you can use the keyword parameters found in librosa.util.peak_pick, e.g. pre_max, post_max, pre_avg, post_avg, delta, and wait, to control the peak picking algorithm. adjust these parameters. how does it affect the detected onsets? mixing transition beatmatching cue points tempo crossfade effects bpm
