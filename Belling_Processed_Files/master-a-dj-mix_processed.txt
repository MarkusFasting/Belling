Mastering final stage processing applied audio file. important master DJ mixes give consistent volume compete mixes. Compression, limiting, equalization common processes involved mastering. DJ.Studio helps easily master DJ mixes check final output. Mastering refers final stage processing applied recorded audio file. originates music production, final mastering stage applied mixdown, however, form recorded audio mastered, including TV radio, movies, case, DJ mixes. main purpose mastering set final dynamic range, tone, volume level audio file. understand mastering, need understand sub-components, terms need understand: Dynamic Range - Describes distance loudest quietest part audio file. Dynamic tracks larger distance loud quiet sections, create punchier variable listening experience. Low dynamic range tracks compressed consistency, less impact. Equalization - process manages balance audio frequency spectrum bands. Equalizers used set balance lows, mids, highs - precise detail, often targeting specific narrow frequency bands. Limiting - process determines maximum dB (decibel) level audio file. Different audio platforms certain specifications maximum loudness, important know set limiter conform specs. Typically somewhere around -1 dB. mastering process often overlooked amateur DJs. However, effect mastering underestimated - essential stage want mixes stand compete. main reasons master DJ sets: One important reasons mastering ensure volume levels consistent across tracks, songs sound similar volume. mixing, moment easy lose perspective volume levels track track. might mean recording, tracks far louder quieter others. create inconsistent listening experience, listener constantly reach volume control - something want avoid. Mastering helps smooth volume level inconsistencies recorded mix, ensuring DJ set offers best listening experience. Another technical reason mastering ensure mix meets requirements distribution format platform. example, streaming sites specific max volume level, differs CDs, radio, streaming sites. mix needs mastered correct volume wherever sent. might involve making multiple final audio files different volumes, mix sent multiple locations. Another reason mastering mix take advantage every last drop potential volume. Ok, know sounds bit weird, think capacity audio file's volume bowl. want make sure bowl full (of volume) possible, make sure wasting 'space' digital file. Strange analogies aside, truth mix must use available digital bits represent volume, helps make mix loud enough sound good sound systems played on, well compete mixes. want mix quiet listeners boost volume dangerous level. Talking competing mixes, another vital reason master entire mix. might heard 'the loudness wars', phenomenon many record producers tried make records louder competition, cranking limiter crushing dynamic range. would mean song would sound louder songs radio, giving upper hand. still something consider making mix. strictly volume-related, mastering gives chance make sound quality mix compete mixes. many elements mix maximised mastering - overall quality (fixing mistakes) frequency balance, making sure lows, mids, highs sound good, stereo imaging - mix sounds nice wide stereo speakers. want mix stand others, professional quality. Mastering go long way improving overall audio quality mix. using combination EQ, saturation, compression, stereo wideners, range mastering tools, really improve refine overall audio quality mix. takes bit skill, add extra layer 'niceness' mix can't achieve standard DJ mixer DJ software. also make tone cohesive throughout. tracks mix already different approach audio mixing mastering applied one, sound naturally pretty different track track. use mastering make tracks sound like they've process, creating seamless immersive listening experience. Even professional DJs still prone making tiny mistakes, even glitches. Mastering gives chance erase correct issues. could sudden jump volume, clunky mix, nasty noise caused bumped cable. mistakes fixed mastering process - also gives final stage checking overall quality - think quality control. Mastering technical logistics, also another stage expression uniqueness shine through. Mastering colorful, artistic process, really get apply signature sound mix. like loud aggressive? Smooth nuanced? Gritty raw? Modern clean? lot room expression mastering (if know tools) really overlooked part creative expression making mix. actually love mastering process, find exciting stage finishing mixes applying final touch artistic vision DJ. shorter reasons mastering DJ mix important. Enhancing sound stage - Use stereo imaging tools affect wide audio output mix is. Adaptation various playback systems - Depending mix played, might want change master settings suit playback system better. File Preparation - Mastering allows make various file formats may need distribute mix, like HD WAV files, compressed MP3s. essential pieces equipment need master DJ mix. might already music production DJ gear, might extra things need. kind DAW - DAW digital audio workstation, essentially piece software lets work audio. helps handle editing, audio processing, exporting mix. Mastering Audio Processors - need access range audio processing tools. DAWs come stock version these, often 3rd party plugin offer better results, make life easier. main tool processors need: Compressor - used controlling dynamic range shaping transients. Equalizer - EQs used changing frequency balance audio spectrum. essential tool. Limiter - aggressive form compression, sets maximum volume output dynamic range. Analysis - beneficial access audio analysis tools - like something showing frequency spectrum detail, well volume metering plugin finding LUFS output. Stereo Image Controller - allow set width stereo image (how wide left right channels) Saturation - Sometimes want add bit crunch bite mix, saturation used for. love running mixes analogue tape emulation warm mix add bit drive. Decent Speakers and/or Headphones - need clean accurate monitoring equipment hear mix processing true detail. Acoustically Treated Space - Probably hardest thing come by. Really want master music acoustically treated environment, get accurate perception mix sounds. mastering often perceived advanced technical skill, actually pretty easy follow clear steps, understand tools hand. following steps show basic mastering process. process fairly flexible too, one best ways start it. (You even apply mastering music producer!) Preparation - touching controls, first, need listen mix start making judgements notes, prep work. Plan, prepare, make notes - Critically listen mix start making notes anything want change improve. Mark places mix need come back change volume elements. might also want compare audio quality mixes think kind processing need stand compete. Give headroom dynamics - Now, need turn mix's output around -6dB give headroom. gives space apply audio processes without hitting top volume meter. worry - might sound quiet start with, maximizing volume later stage. Equalization - EQ process setting balance frequencies, typically low, mids, highs (and various subdivisions) two main types EQ processing mastering phase Corrective - Corrective EQing applied first, order remove frequency-related issues mix. example, tracks might build-up certain frequencies, may excessively boosted bass/highs one part. might need automate EQ balance unwanted frequencies time. Creative/Enhancing - time use EQ shape tone mix tastes. gives chance create cohesive frequency balance also set frequencies make mix sound like. common practice add 'smiley face' EQ curve, bass highs boosted, ultimately EQ however like. Compression Dynamic Controls - EQing, time start compressing mix taming dynamic range. Mastering compression - Compressors tools let set dynamic range - either compress expand mix. Typically mastering, compressor applied even volume track track. basic settings, would suggest: Set compressor threshold constantly clips peaks (but flattens) dynamic. play attack release transients sound like. ratio 1:2 1:3 good place start here. may also choose high pass sidechain, means bass dominate compressor, override higher frequencies, depends much pump thump want mix. Limiting - aggressive form compression, user sets maximum decibel volume mix. prevents audio going louder limiting dB value. general, set limiter around -1dB prevent clipping channel. set final output later stages based distribution platform specification. Stereo Imaging - Stereo imaging tools help set width mix left right speakers. Sometimes might want give mix slight stereo boost wider image, might want narrower focussed stereo field. mix electronic music-focused, often beneficial bass mono (or narrow) width applied higher frequencies. Loudness optimization - One final technical stages setting LUFS (loudness units full scale). standardized measurement volume incorporates audio's dynamic range, distribution platform format may require slightly different LUFS level example Spotify normalizes audio -14 LUFS, CDs typically range higher, often around -9 -12 LUFS, YouTube normalizes uploaded audio content around -14 LUFS. using LUFS metering software changing output limter. Finalizing quality control - nearly done, couple things need finish mix off. Dithering - advanced topic (which explain full detail), helps maximise audio quality mixing. essence, dithering applies tiny amount noise mix, helps smooth audio downsampling resolution (for example, 24-bit 16-bit, HQ wav lower resolution MP3). usually find option export process audio software. Final listen-through - exporting, final listen-through mix make sure happy mastering. not, go back make changes. often worth comparing another mix like sound stage, checking competes. Export settings file type - Now, finally export finished file. Choose right file type(s) like WAV, MP3, whatever required destination. export. Voila! Revisions - sending final destination, worth bit feedback stage make sure quality high possible. often send mixes friends audio engineers get second opinion, also often worth listening mix week, coming back refreshed ears. That's it! process mastering slightly different orders, one easiest ways it. may need every process every mix. Sometimes might happy frequency balance stereo width is. Remember, critical listening foundation good mastering engineer. Listen closely, compare work mixes, make something sounds nice comparison. art science, over-process it, get sounding right. Understanding logistics process mastering one thing, also need look artist's lens. like think mastering final layer paint artistic vision mix. questions ask mastering DJ mix... mix transitions right impact punch? frequency balance nice ears? harsh anomalies? make mix sound hold DJs competition? anything make overall listening experience enjoyable memorable? overprocessed? Sometimes less more.
