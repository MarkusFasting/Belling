I'll outline basics, go detail. Decks Mixers Headphones Speakers Audio interface worth noting today, many different equipment setups use. could old-school-style hardware, could completely digitally. said, types DJ setups replicate system decks, mixer, headphones, speakers. One important DJ mixing techniques beginners learn tools use DJ set. DJ decks pieces equipment holds plays music. originally vinyl turntables, although evolved CD decks, digital decks. give controls play pause music, typically give slider controlling playback speed match beats. Mixers piece equipment really made DJing possible, otherwise, would listen one record another. plug multiple decks mixer (usually either 2 4 decks), given independent controls multiple audio tracks. used set volume EQ balance music playing decks. also separate cue output, lets preview music headphones bring volume crowd. Using volume faders EQ controls, use mixer smoothly mixing songs, making clean seamless transitions DJ set. DJ Headphones let hear next song cue, make sure lined right play audience. means check music current tracks playing, making sure aligned playing main speakers. Speakers play music main audience, typical live DJ setup. essential want get dance floor moving! Audio interfaces optional pieces gear used recording mix PC. necessarily need DJ performance, however, good idea record sets, many DJs do. beginner, need buy expensive professional equipment get started DJing. days pick basic (but sufficient) DJ controller affordable price start practicing skills. also good house parties mixing move! even need hardware mix tracks make DJ sets purely using DJ app. get gear need start $150. really need get started mixing music is: laptop computer (Find DJ laptop here!) Headphones Speakers DJing Software DJ controller (this even optional) bunch different types DJ software there, unique designs purposes. vital piece equipment making DJ sets. DJing originated hardware physical equipment, days computers powerful enough offer virtual DJing solutions using software alone. Obviously, experience slightly different - using keyboard mouse rather knobs buttons. However, find many digital DJ controllers plug computer control software with. nice use they're portable, affordable, still offer tools controls traditional DJ gear. really two types DJ software, designed slightly different purposes. distinction is, DJ software designed used live performances instance - DJs mixing live nightclub radio. second type Studio Style design software, built DJs need perform live need create distribute pre-recorded mix. advantages disadvantages creating DJ sets. example, live mixing software great real-time, live performances, however, putting together set (when need live) much time-consuming record 1:1 use time. 1 hour mixing = 1 hour recording share. make mistakes go back edit even record whole set, makes process even inefficient. time, studio software far quicker use, saves huge amount time. get creative transitions effects things real-time manually arranging things. also matter make mistakes want change things around. gives whole new perspective DJing. However, lack hands-on feeling, obviously work nightclub. Studio-style DJ software much useful people need produce sets quickly without actually needing perform live, like DJ.Studio best DJ software platforms beginners. DJ.Studio rekordbox Traktor Virtual DJ Serato/ Serato DJ Pro got hands right equipment, time understand core controls used mixing music making DJ sets. Throughout different genres DJs perform, use exact controls. controls are: Volume controls (gain) - Channel Faders, Cross Faders Pitch/Tempo slider EQ Cue play Jogging scratching Effects Volume, correctly called gain, one important controls also easiest understand. Simply turn gain increase volume (make music louder), turn gain decrease volume (make quieter). Gain controls typically found three different places throughout mixer. order gains stacked is: 1. Track Gain > 2. Channel Fader > 3. Cross Fader means, track gain sets volume start chain, edited turn channel fader crossfader. types gain control different uses making DJ sets. Understanding use all, need three, important help make transitions manage volumes tracks. (You also master volume, sets level master output, although worth explaining detail). first one track gain (aka Trim). Now, sets internal volume track mixer, deck. confused crossfader channel fader controls volume independently channel gain. used match levels music, different tracks come different volumes. Although really used expression. Track gain place boost volume. two controls simply let reduce volume zero maximum level set track gain expressive way. Pro DJs use balance volumes making sure damage sound quality turning volume much distorting it. channel fader used control volume either channel 1 2 independently (or mixers four channels). used slowly bring gain transition song mix. final one crossfader. works differently others. Essentially, crossfader lets blend channels one two. great way switch one track next track, back forth. So, crossfader perfectly middle, volume tracks same. However, move crossfader left, turns first channel turns second channel. crossfade full left would hear track one - track two would completely silent. reverse, move crossfader right, channel two gets louder, channel one gets quieter. - fully right hearing channel two. core tool hip-hop scratching technique. next core tool pitch/tempo slider (pitch tempo used interchangeably). control found decks, rather mixer. tempo slider controls playback speed music playing deck. neutral position, track play exactly speed released at. track released 120 BPM, play 120 BPM. move pitch slider either increase decrease playback speed track. usually marked percentage slider show amount speed change. important tool lets beat match tracks - get play tempo. increase pitch slider, track plays faster, decrease it, plays slower. Say track originally 120 BPM. increase pitch slider plus 10%, play around 132 bpm However, put pitch slider 10% track play 108 BPM. use match playback speed two songs make seamless transition. Pro DJs use tool many times DJ set. EQ, short equalization, control lets change tone (more technically, frequency balance) track. Usually, set EQ controls channel fader mixer. EQ typically split three bands - high mid low (or technically, treble mid, bass). DJ controllers mixers feature three-band EQ system, although sometimes see 4 2 bands. EQ controls let either cut boost level band. example, use cut bass boost bass either track. EQ tools multiple purposes. one, help slightly adjust balance track's tone helping sculpt DJ set expressive way. instance, play heaviness bass boost treble make certain elements stick out. Also, help mix room, speaker lacking bass, boost it. Alternatively, they're useful transitions. mixing two tracks together might want bass lines blasting time. So, might introduce next track DJ set bass cut slowly bring new bass turn old bass line - making switch-over effect. See guide EQ Mixing deeper dive topic. Filters similar EQs work aggressive way. also great making transitions playing crowd adjusting music. two main kinds filters DJing. Either high cut low cut. remove frequencies based type. example, use high-cut filter, apply it, fewer highs are, eventually put way would leave bass kick drum playing. Alternatively, low-cut filter, deletes lows. turn low cut filter, bass disappears, mid disappears, eventually, leaves top frequencies treble band. ideal transitions getting creative dance floor whether mixing electronic dance music old school disco classics. DJ decks controllers, see two separate buttons triggering music - one Play/Pause button Cue button. work slightly differently, unique purpose DJ. important understand differ need both. Play/Pause button works expect - hit play button play tracks, press again, pauses. Cue button, hand, works differently, important tool beginner pro DJs alike. hold Cue button, track plays - soon let go Cue button, track stops returns back start. (Or wherever set cue point.) Cue button useful beat matching, repeatedly test whether new track aligned first track playing without press play, press pause, skip back start. simply keep pressing holding Cue button adjusting pitch slider. I'll explain beat matching detail later Jogging scratching revolve around use platter. old days DJing vinyl turntables, decks physics-based devices. touch spinning surface, would affect music playing. eventually became used scratching technique, common hip hop, people would scratch records make new, rhythmic sound effect. Jogging based physical principles, used quickly slide record forward backward tiny bit case beats slip sync. one turntable slightly slower others might need push forward tiny bit catch up. Jogging advanced old-fashioned technique relevant age digital gear DJs sync button automatically locks tracks together. want make remixes real-time, key tool. final tools DJing effects. find bunch different sound effects let get creative DJing. effects available depend hardware software using, however, common others. two common important effects understand reverb delay. color transform sound different ways. Reverb makes sounds blurry extends decay, creating long, washed-out sounds. Delays create repeats time - beat track, used creative way. Loops another kind effect useful DJing select short phrase instance 24 8 bars play repeated loop. these, effects super useful transitions, creative expression DJ set. several core techniques used DJing. Beat matching absolutely essential skill DJs. arguably one important DJ Mixing Techniques learn enable make seamless transitions tracks. essentially two parts matching beats: Matching tempo two tracks mix, play exact speed. Aligning phase, tracks playing beat. count music, count typically "1 2 3 4 ". want counts lined two songs. want 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s hitting exact time, rather 1 hitting time 2 track. beat-match music tracks, follow steps: first step detecting BPM two tracks. Much modern software DJ gear automatic tempo detection show BPM track automatically. Alternatively, use BPM counter like website tap along track count BPM. need match two BPMs together. change speed track using pitch slider. Either speed slow tempo track. lets match BPMs two tracks playing speed. ear quite tricky, takes practice, learn technique become second nature. key use Cue button. one track playing main PA system speakers. counting beats 1, 2, 3, 4 first track, line second track start first beat bar. Then, first beat first track, press hold Cue button second track, listen see tempos time. usually easiest hear kicks snares match up. tracks time, need adjust pitch slider second track make quicker slower match first track. beats aligned, bring volume second track, make another kind transition. Manually matching beats take long time master, software hard work you. easier use kind software early days understand BPM matching works start practicing manual technique. DJ.Studio great example this. look guide Beat Matching Techniques info! cue button essential component mixing whole cue system mechanism enables DJs prepare next track seamless transition. Essentially lets hear track two places - first track coming main speakers, prepare second track privately. cue channel comes headphones rather main speakers. Getting grips system essentially one foundations DJing works live setting. Transitioning tracks another one pillars DJing. transitioning smoothly may well play playlist let switch songs. transition tracks several tools, techniques, theories learn. also different styles transition. essence, main tool volume faders let lower volume one channel bringing volume next track's channel. several tools help make transitions smoother let sculpt flow sets. mostly EQs, filters, effects like reverbs, delays, loops.
